# nudge_learning

This study investigates how nudges embedded within an educational game affect users' engagement with educational content. Users are randomly assigned to one of four game versions that differ only in the presence and nature of a nudge presented during gameplay. The nudge encourages users to engage in educational activities and offers XP (in-game progress) as a reward.

# Conditions

Participants (users) are randomly assigned to one of four conditions:

Control – No nudge is given.

Minigame Nudge – Users are nudged toward a math minigame.

Activity Nudge – Users are nudged toward a more interactive math activity.

History Nudge – Users are nudged toward a history activity.

All nudges are designed to encourage work (i.e., educational engagement) and offer XP as a reward. The core mechanics of the game are otherwise unchanged across versions.

# Sample Size and Randomization

We will use existing users from the game platform. Participants will be randomly assigned to conditions using a platform-level randomization protocol. The sample will consist of users who reach the nudge decision point. This experiment will run for the length of time that the version of the game is available.

# Primary Outcome Variables

Total Work: total time spent in educational content (minigames and activities).

Total Time: total time spent in the game.

D1: whether the user returns the day after their first session.

W0: whether the user returns within the first week of play.

Total Work and Total Time will be further split into short-term (within 10 minutes after the nudge) and long-term (after the first 10 minutes).

# Hypotheses
Confirmatory Hypotheses

[H1] Activity nudges will increase total work more than minigame nudges.

[H2] Minigame nudges will increase total work more than no nudge.

[H3] There will be no significant difference in total time spent in-game across conditions.

[H4] There will be no significant difference in D1 (next-day return) or W0 (week return) across conditions.

[H5] Nudges will increase short-term work (within 10 minutes), but also long-term work.

[H6] Users who accept the nudge will spend more time on work in the short term than those who ignore it.

[H7] Among users who accept the nudge, activity nudges will lead to longer engagement than minigame nudges.

[H8] The type of content (math vs. history) affects the likelihood that a user accepts the nudge.

# Statistical Analysis Plan

For each outcome (e.g., total work), we will use one-way ANOVA. If found to be not normal, we will use the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare distributions across the four conditions. If significant, we will follow with Dunn’s test for pairwise comparisons, adjusting p-values using the Holm method.

For binary outcomes (D1, W0), we will use Chi-square tests, followed by pairwise tests with Holm adjustment if significant. 

For outcomes broken into short-term and long-term periods, we will analyze these separately using the same approach.

# Data Inclusion Criteria

We include only users who play the game for the first time during this version. We also consider the subpopulation who reach the point where the nudge is offered (or would have been offered in the control group). Users with missing or corrupted logs will be excluded.
